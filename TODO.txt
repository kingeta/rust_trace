Separate out files more

Make get_min/get_min_index return optionals instead of having weird behaviour for items not in list

Make things into traits so that I can finally implement image textures etc

Improve scene; make it into a struct instead of a single slice:

- Improve the background function somehow; make it part of scene

- Make some sort of scene intersection function, ideally returning an optional tuple of what was hit (index I guess) and how far away it was hit
  (note; could return where the hit was; instead of bumping intersection with normal, just ignore intersections of distance less than epsilon)

-- This would allow for raymarching etc with different scene intersection functions


Separate files:

(Where does the trace function go? Maybe render file with trace function, perhaps world intersections)

Materials
- Structure
- Brdfs
- Metal, glass etc
Textures
- Structure
- Flat, checkered, image based etc
Primitives
- Some trait thing
- Spheres, planes, boxes, triangles ideally
Scene ??
- Some background functions
- Scene intersections perhaps, scene structure
Vector
- Vectors
-- Implement colour stuff so that colours are vectors/derived from vectors

git-ignore *.png probably
